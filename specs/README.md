# Expert Finder demo implementation plan

Planning deliverable, ready for review. No application implementation is included in this change.

This is a community conference demo. Keep the implementation easy to explain, attractive, and reliable. Verification consists of the existing build and practical Workbench/Copilot checks. Do not add unit tests, test infrastructure, coverage targets, CI, or production architecture that does not serve the session.

## Start here

1. [GLOBAL.md](GLOBAL.md): requirements, shared contracts, visual brief, and scope limits.
2. [tasks/plan.md](tasks/plan.md): build order and checkpoints.
3. [tasks/todo.md](tasks/todo.md): the single progress checklist, including manual checks.
4. [IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md](IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md): one prompt to execute the local implementation without pausing between features.

## Feature map

| Feature | Scope | Depends on | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| expert-data | Skill, model, mock service, fictional data and local portraits | none | [Spec](expert-data/spec.md), [Tasks](expert-data/tasks.md) |
| contact-actions | Teams action and clearly simulated Schedule | expert-data | [Spec](contact-actions/spec.md), [Tasks](contact-actions/tasks.md) |
| inline-experience | Input seam, host shell, compact results and states | expert-data, contact-actions | [Spec](inline-experience/spec.md), [Tasks](inline-experience/tasks.md) |
| fullscreen-experience | Search, filters and responsive expert cards | inline-experience | [Spec](fullscreen-experience/spec.md), [Tasks](fullscreen-experience/tasks.md) |
| copilot-integration | Tool descriptions, agent instructions and starters | inline-experience | [Spec](copilot-integration/spec.md), [Tasks](copilot-integration/tasks.md) |
| sharepoint-integration | Experts list guide, filtered REST provider and identity/photos | expert-data, inline-experience | [Spec](sharepoint-integration/spec.md), [Tasks](sharepoint-integration/tasks.md) |
| expert-availability | On-demand fullscreen calendar free/busy panel for one selected expert | sharepoint-integration, fullscreen-experience, existing Graph infrastructure | [Spec](expert-availability/spec.md), [Tasks](expert-availability/tasks.md) |
| introduce-me | Fullscreen selected-profile context and a user-triggered introduction draft in Copilot chat (implemented locally; host acceptance pending) | fullscreen-experience, copilot-integration, public Copilot Bridge | [Spec](introduce-me/spec.md), [Tasks](introduce-me/tasks.md) |
| demo-readiness | Package, installation notes, demo script and fallback | all above | [Spec](demo-readiness/spec.md), [Tasks](demo-readiness/tasks.md) |

Introduce me is implemented locally; actual host checks remain pending. Its [feature-specific implementation prompt](introduce-me/tasks.md#single-implementation-prompt) selects this work without reopening the baseline implementation.

All detailed task definitions live with their feature. Completion status and observed results live only in tasks/todo.md. The latest written requirements take priority over earlier requirements and over extra details in the promotional mockup. These specs apply only to `src/copilot-expert-finder`; Hello Copilot is outside scope.

Repository documentation, code, comments, logs, and UI copy use English. Explanations to the user use Spanish.
