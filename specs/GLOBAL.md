# Global specification: Expert Finder community demo

## Goal and current base

Demonstrate a useful visual application inside Microsoft 365 Copilot: a prompt identifies a skill, the agent invokes ExpertFinderTool, the component loads matching experts, and the user explores them inline or in fullscreen.

Use the existing project at `src/copilot-expert-finder`. Inspected baseline: SPFx 1.24.1, React/React DOM 18.3.1, TypeScript 5.8.3 strict, Fluent UI v9 9.75.1, Zod 4.6.7, Heft 1.3.2. Reinspect before implementation. The initial scaffold accepted message and made demonstration Graph/site reads. The current implementation accepts skill, automatically selects a source from the root Experts list, and retains createRoot, host context, FluentProvider targetDocument, and teardown. Preserve those useful lifecycle patterns and the existing component, solution, and agent IDs.

## Demo quality bar

Keep only what helps the conference experience. Use small React components and a simple service interface. Verification is compilation/lint/packaging through the existing build plus manual functional and visual checks. Do not add unit tests, automated integration suites, test libraries, coverage requirements, CI pipelines, telemetry platforms, or architectural frameworks. Keep runtime argument validation, safe SharePoint queries, understandable error/loading states, and image fallback because they prevent a broken demo.

The implementation stages remain mock UI -> Copilot discovery -> SharePoint -> package/demo. Introduce the minimal skill input while building the mock UI so Workbench can exercise the real contract; complete the agent wording later.

## Fixed input and domain contract

ExpertFinderTool receives one required skill string. Validate raw arguments with Zod at runtime, trim/collapse whitespace, compare casing consistently, and normalize to one of SPFx, Copilot, DB, Spanish. Reject empty, overlong, malformed, or unsupported input before querying expert items. The independent list-availability check occurs once during initialization. An 80-character maximum is sufficient. Keep JSON Schema conversion compatible with the installed Zod/SPFx generator; avoid unsupported schema transforms.

Skill is fixed for an invocation. Changing it requires a new Copilot request. No Skill selector or All Skills option exists in the UI.

```typescript
export type ExpertSkill = 'SPFx' | 'Copilot' | 'DB' | 'Spanish';

export interface Expert {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly displayName: string;
  readonly jobTitle: string;
  readonly skill: ExpertSkill;
  readonly shortCV: string;
  readonly department: string;
  readonly userPrincipalName?: string;
  readonly email?: string;
  readonly photoUrl?: string;
}

export interface IExpertService {
  getExpertsBySkill(skill: ExpertSkill): Promise<Expert[]>;
}
```

Use one canonical skill registry. Mock and SharePoint services expose the same skill-scoped boundary. React never receives experts for other skills. Raw SharePoint response types stay inside that adapter. No second LLM, chatbot, backend, Redux, CQRS, or generic repository framework is needed.

## Data sources

Start with roughly 15 fictional records: SPFx 6, Copilot 8, DB 1, Spanish 0. This supports several results, more than three, one result, and no results. Include varied departments/roles and use Alex Morgan, Sam Carter, and Jamie Taylor as the first SPFx examples. Mark mock mode visibly as Demo data.

Bundle local photographic portraits and a short provenance/license record. Generated portraits must depict fictional adults; stock photos must be lawfully redistributable and clearly illustrative. Do not fetch avatars from a third-party service at runtime. Fall back gracefully when a photo is unavailable.

Final SharePoint list: Experts.

| Internal name | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Title | Single line text | Job title / Role |
| Expert | Person, single value | Person name and identity |
| Skill | Choice, single value | One canonical skill |
| ShortCV | Multiple lines, plain text | Professional summary |
| Department | Single line text | Department |

SharePoint MUST filter on the server using Skill eq '<canonical value>'. Escape OData literals and encode query values, select only required fields, and expand the Person field. Use SPHttpClient with delegated user access. Never download the full list to search by skill or remove the filter as a fallback. This is a small demo list, not a large-directory search system; handle an unexpected continuation explicitly rather than silently reporting incomplete totals.

Use one asynchronous provider factory outside React. Derive the tenant root from `new URL(this.context.pageContext.web.absoluteUrl).origin` and check `/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('Experts')?$select=Id` once when the component initializes. HTTP 200 selects SharePointExpertService; HTTP 404 selects MockExpertService. Other HTTP failures and network errors remain visible errors. Return the selected service and isDemo together so the source badge and contact behavior match the actual choice. No manual data-source, site-URL or list-name settings remain. An empty existing list or zero skill matches is an empty SharePoint result, never a reason to switch to mocks. Later item-read failures do not trigger another fallback; reload to select the source again. This supersedes the earlier explicit configuration/default-mock decision.

Resolve Teams identity through the supported SharePoint Person information. A mail attribute does not guarantee the UPN required by Teams. If identity cannot be resolved, explain why contact is unavailable.

The [Graph profile photo change](tasks/plan.md#graph-profile-photos) is implemented locally: live photos use delegated Graph v1.0 through MSGraphClientV3, reusing the already approved compatible permission. Cards render before photos; the small skill result set loads photos in parallel with a circular shimmer until each image loads, per-instance caching and initials on failure. Local mock portraits remain bundled and make no Graph calls. The loader has a five-second logical timeout and the avatar a separate five-second image-load limit; Blob URLs are released on teardown. See the [Graph permission guide](../src/copilot-expert-finder/docs/graph-permissions.md). Actual component authorization, host visuals and cold/warm latency remain pending. Do not add Graph profile beta APIs or new package permission requests.

## State and host behavior

Await source selection once in onInit at the SPFx composition boundary. This small metadata request completes before the first React render; React still owns loading the actual expert items. Keep one React root, mount through context.domElement, preserve targetDocument for Fluent styling, and clean up on teardown. Remove starter Graph /me and /_api/web requests that do not contribute to Expert Finder.

The React root owns the invocation skill, fetched results/load state, and name/department/role filters. Derive visible results with a pure helper/useMemo. Read the effective host theme/mode directly; request fullscreen through the installed supported API and handle denial honestly.

Theme/mode/size changes and local filters must not refetch data. Preserve fetched results and local filter state across ordinary re-renders. Inline always shows the full invocation total and its first three experts; returning to fullscreen restores local exploration. A genuine new skill resets incompatible local state. Ignore stale async completions after retry, changed invocation, or unmount. A real host teardown/new instance may fetch again; no cross-instance cache is required.

Show loading, success, no skill matches, no local filter matches, invalid input, and error states. Provide an explicit retry for retrieval failures. Check HTTP status and response shape, bound slow retrieval with a simple timeout, and do not create a retry framework or pretend a logical timeout cancels transport.

## Visual brief

Reproduce only the inner Expert Finder UI from the user's mockup. The chat image is not currently stored in the repository; this brief is sufficient to implement without it. Exclude the conference banner, neon framing, explanatory arrows, and host-owned close/pop-out controls.

Use Fluent UI v9 with light/dark semantic tokens, purple primary actions, restrained blue/teal accents, soft corners, quiet borders/shadows, generous spacing, and clear typography. A subtle decorative lavender/blue header wave is enough; no animation library is needed.

Inline: people/search icon, Expert Finder title, correct count for the requested skill, up to three compact photo/name/title rows with Teams action, an indication of more results, and Open in fullscreen when the host supports it. Do not show summaries, departments, or extra skills there.

Fullscreen: Expert Finder header, fixed Experts in <skill> subtitle/badge, a wrapping toolbar, result count, and a responsive grid. Cards include photograph, full name, job title, a short professional summary, department, Chat in Teams, and Schedule. Expanded cards provide the detailed profile information; no separate drawer is needed for this version. Omit location, multiple skill tags, undefined overflow menus, and grid/list switching.

Filters are exclusively Search by name, Department, Role, and Clear filters. Name compares normalized full-display-name startsWith, not contains/fuzzy/semantic search. Department/Role compare normalized exact values; active filters combine with AND. Dropdown options come from the full fetched skill dataset. All includes that subset, including missing optional metadata. Clear filters resets only these three controls and makes no request.

Use real accessible labels, useful names for icon buttons, visible focus, readable contrast, announcements for loading/results/errors, and proper dialog focus. Check both themes around 320/768/1280 px and at 200% zoom, including long text and missing photographs. Cards must fit the host without horizontal overflow.

## Contact actions

Live Chat in Teams opens the supported HTTPS chat deep link with a verified, encoded UPN via the host bridge; it sends no message. Fictional mock contacts open a clearly labeled preview instead of launching a chat for an invented account. Schedule opens a clearly labeled demo dialog saying no meeting has been created. The Availability Panel supports free/busy reads and, following the user-approved extension, explicitly confirmed Teams meeting invitations from future Free slots for another expert. Schedule remains a preview. Presence and autonomous calendar/message writes remain outside scope.

## Availability panel

The [Expert Availability Panel](expert-availability/spec.md) is implemented locally following [four tasks](expert-availability/tasks.md); actual host/tenant acceptance remains pending. Check availability opens only the selected fullscreen card's panel. GraphAvailabilityService uses the existing SPFx Graph factory for today's local 09:00–18:00, normalized to UTC, with 18 half-hour free/busy slots and a ten-second logical timeout. The typed boundary discards event details and rejects empty, malformed or failed availability instead of inventing Free slots. Optional Expert.email comes from Person EMail; the UPN still serves photos/Teams. No list column was added.

The panel has local loading, accessible text markers/tooltips, both-theme semantic colors, a current-slot clock and explicit Refresh/retry. Only its active result is retained; selecting another expert, filtering it out, changing skill or leaving fullscreen clears the panel and ignores stale responses. There is no calendar prefetch or persistent cache. Missing email and mock mode make no calendar request. Search, photo caching and contact/Schedule behavior remain independent.

Calendar reads and explicitly confirmed Teams meeting invitations supersede the earlier read-only availability limit; Schedule remains a demo preview. Keep the no-unit-tests quality bar and CLI consent workflow. The user reports Calendars.ReadWrite granted on 2026-11-04. No webApiPermissionRequests, consent changes or additional dependencies were added by implementation. A working Graph photo does not prove mailbox or Teams meeting access. Status and observed results remain in tasks/todo.md.

## Confirmed Teams meetings

The [availability feature's booking flow](expert-availability/spec.md#confirmed-teams-meetings) permits one real 30-minute Teams invitation only after an explicit Create Teams meeting confirmation. Future Free slots for another expert are buttons; self detection uses normalized SPFx user email/login and expert SMTP/UPN. Missing identity, mock mode, past/current slots and previously requested slots remain informational.

GraphMeetingService uses the existing SPFx Graph factory, verifies Teams support and both calendars, then creates `/me/events` with the caller as organizer, the expert as attendee, plain-text notes, UTC times, Teams online settings and transactionId. No new auth flow, backend or dependencies. A per-instance attempt guard prevents duplicate/in-flight/uncertain repeats; it is not a persistent cross-instance booking system. Success shows the Teams link and immediately marks the expert/UTC interval Busy from a confirmed in-memory booking. That local mark survives Refresh, expert switches and fullscreen remounts within the component instance even when Graph still says Free; no extra post-success availability call or persistent storage is needed. Tooltips and a panel note distinguish session-created meetings from calendar acceptance. Full reload/disposal clears local records; later Outlook cancellations or declines are not tracked. Unknown creation outcomes require checking Outlook; a link read failure never triggers a second event creation. Opening the dialog and Cancel before confirmation do not create an event. No live meeting was created during implementation checks.

## Minimal code organization

Keep the entry class and adapt components/ExpertFinder.tsx as the app root. Add models/Expert.ts; utils/skills.ts and expertFilters.ts; services/IExpertService.ts, MockExpertService.ts, SharePointExpertService.ts; a small asynchronous provider factory; data/mockExperts.ts and local assets. Add inline/fullscreen/search/card/avatar/action components only as their responsibilities justify them. Avoid multiplying helper layers. Use strict TypeScript, hooks, existing formatting, English copy, and Fluent v9. Preserve existing localization where useful without an i18n overhaul.

## Commands and checks

Run from src/copilot-expert-finder:

```bash
npm run build
npm start -- --nobrowser
```

Use the existing build script as generated/configured. Verify the production sppkg at sharepoint/solution/copilot-expert-finder.sppkg and generated agent ZIP under teams. For local hosting the debug manifests are served at https://localhost:4321/temp/build/manifests.js. Set SPFX_SERVE_TENANT_DOMAIN for automatic tenant URL substitution or navigate to Workbench manually.

Do not change project watchers to fix an agent-sandbox-only fs.watch/EMFILE restriction; use an authorized normal execution context after diagnosis. A successful build does not establish actual Workbench rendering, natural Copilot discovery, or live SharePoint permissions.

## Authority and completion

A future single implementation prompt may cover all local features without approval between each one. New dependencies or broader permissions need a concrete reason and approval. Tenant provisioning/seeding, package upload/sync, and publishing need the corresponding authorization. No secrets, raw HTML insertion, autonomous messages/meetings, fake presence, or changes to Hello Copilot. The user-authorized Teams booking flow may send a real invitation only after its explicit in-app confirmation; agent/build validation does not create meetings or change the tenant.

External prerequisites: browser/tenant access, root-site access for the availability check, a correctly provisioned root Experts list and real test-user mappings when showing live data, and a deployed/synced agent. A root-list HTTP 404 intentionally selects fictional demo data. Finish independent local work if one is unavailable; leave the corresponding manual checklist open and report the exact missing input. Do not manufacture publisher metadata, contact identities, screenshots, or successful host results.

Local completion means the code, lawful assets, build/package, setup notes and demo runbook are ready. Host/tenant validation is complete only when the manual checks in tasks/todo.md have actual recorded results.

## Introduce me extension

The [Introduce me spec](introduce-me/spec.md) adds a user-triggered fullscreen action that publishes only the selected expert's professional context and asks the existing Copilot host to draft an introduction with exactly three relevant questions. It does not add a model/backend, Graph permission, search tool argument or automatic Teams send. Drafting from selected-profile context is distinct from normal expert-search routing. One shared handoff guard prevents concurrent card actions from mixing context; errors stay local and mock/Workbench limitations remain explicit.

This extension is implemented locally, with host acceptance pending. Follow [IM-01 through IM-04](introduce-me/tasks.md) and preserve the no-unit-tests/demo quality bar and existing search, photo, contact and calendar behaviors. Progress and actual host evidence remain in the shared checklist; local build/package verification does not imply tenant deployment or successful model output.
